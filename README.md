Usage
To use this project, clone it on your machine and open it on your IDE.

To run the test automation, you can simply run all the tests located at the src/main/resources/Features dir. This is possible because the ParaBank application is already running on a web server.

But if you would like to run only one test case, you can open the Signup.feature file as an example, and run its tests.

Once you run the tests, Selenium Webdriver will open a browser and execute the steps defined on the test file.
